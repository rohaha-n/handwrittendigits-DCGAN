# handwrittendigits-DCGAN
A TensorFlow-based implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) trained on the MNIST dataset to generate realistic handwritten digit images. The model learns to create new digit samples from random noise, demonstrating the generative capabilities of GANs in image synthesis.
